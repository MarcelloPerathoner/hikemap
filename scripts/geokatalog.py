#
# 1. Test if every segment of the geokatalog route is contained in a buffer
# around the OSM route.
#
# 2. Test if every segment of the OSM route is contained in a buffer around the
# geokatalog route.
#
# In an OSM route a segment can be any of 'main', 'alternative', 'connection',
# 'approach', 'excursion' etc.  In geokatalog a route may be split in segments
# at admin borders but often also in a quite arbitrary fashion.
#
# Thus the OSM route and the geokatalog route may turn out to be split into
# segments in different (and sometimes interesting) ways.
